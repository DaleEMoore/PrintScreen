Hi Mike;

I hope that your email doesn't reject this because I've attached some .py files.

INSTALL
Find a recent distribution at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/, and install.

Find a recent distribution at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/ or 64-bit at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyhook, and install

RUN
python main.py
q to Quit
PrintScreen to get screenshot#.bmp written to the current directory.
The # becomes 1, then 2, ... If the file exists IT'S OVERWRITTEN.
AltPrintScreen gets the whole screen, just like PrintScreen.

I hope it works OK for you,
Dale
